DIVISION B--FURTHER EXTENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018  Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to most federal agencies through March 23, 2018 (February 8, 2018, under current law).  It prevents a partial government shutdown that would otherwise occur when the existing continuing resolution expires because the FY2018 appropriations bills have not been enacted.  The division also: (1) authorizes the Department of Energy to drawdown and sell specified crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in FY2018; and (2) makes additional funding available for the 2020 Decennial Census Program, the Southeastern Power Administration, and juror fees.  The division provides emergency funding for the Small Business Administration Disaster Loans Program Account. (Emergency spending is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules.)  DIVISION C--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018  This division provides appropriations to the Department of Defense for the remainder of FY2018.  DIVISION D--MISCELLANEUOUS  This division amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to extend the Department of Agriculture Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) through FY2019. (EQIP provides financial and technical assistance for agricultural producers and land owners to implement certain conservation practices.)  DIVISION E--TAX MATTERS  This division amends the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 to repeal the 8% increase in the amount of the required installment of corporate estimated tax otherwise due in July, August, or September of 2020. It also increases the next required installment to reflect the amount of the decrease due to this division.  DIVISION F--HEALTH PROVISIONS  Strengthening and Underpinning the Safety-net to Aid Individuals Needing Care Act of 2018 or the SUSTAIN Care Act of 2018 This division extends and otherwise revises various Medicare programs and payment rules, including:    the Medicare-dependent hospital program;   the Independence at Home Demonstration Program;   certain outreach and counseling programs; and   specified payment rules related to certain low-volume hospitals, home health-care services, and misvalued services.   Additionally, the division modifies Medicare provisions related to supervision requirements, home-health claims, intensive cardiac-rehabilitation programs, telehealth, accountable care organizations, medical records, accreditation, physician self-referral, speech-generating devices, fraud and abuse, coverage of certain testing services, hospital transfers to hospice, ambulance transports, certain outpatient therapy services, long-term care hospital payments, and biosimilar products.  With respect to Medicare Advantage, the division:    reauthorizes and otherwise revises special-needs plans;   expands testing of the Value-Based Insurance Design Model; and   modifies provisions related to supplemental benefits, telehealth, and quality ratings.   With respect to Medicaid, the bill modifies provisions related to third-party liability, lump-sum income, and disproportionate-share hospital payments.  The division reduces annual funding available to the Medicare Improvement Fund and the Medicaid Improvement Fund and modifies the amount of annual funding available to the Prevention and Public Health Fund.  The division also extends specified public health programs.  In addition, the division establishes or revises various reporting requirements for the Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, certain suppliers of ground ambulance services, and the Government Accountability Office.  Family First Prevention Services Act  The division modifies various provisions related to foster care and adoption. Specifically, the division:    revises funding and eligibility requirements with respect to foster-care prevention services and programs; limits federal funding for placements that are not in foster-family homes;   provides for grants to support the recruitment and retention of high-quality foster families;   provides for social-impact partnerships;   extends and otherwise revises various other programs; and   modifies provisions related to foster-care maintenance payments, evidence-based kinship navigator programs, family-reunification services, interstate case processing, regional-partnership grants, qualified residential-treatment programs, records checks, adoption assistance, child-support enforcement, and prison-data reporting.   DIVISION G--BUDGETARY EFFECTS  This division exempts the budgetary effects of division D and each succeeding division of this bill from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules and certain budget scorekeeping guidelines.

Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act of 2017 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require intermediate providers that offer the capability to transmit voice communications and signaling information from one destination to another, and that charge a rate to any other entity (including an affiliated entity) for such a transmission, to: (1) register with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and (2) comply with service quality standards to be established by the FCC.  An \"intermediate provider\" is an entity that: (1) enters a business arrangement with a long-distance voice service provider that makes the initial call path choice for more than 100,000 domestic retail subscriber lines, or with another intermediate provider, to carry, route, or transmit voice traffic from a call placed from or to an end user connection using a North American Numbering Plan resource; and (2) does not itself (directly or in conjunction with an affiliate) serve as such a long-distance initial call path choice provider in the context of originating or terminating a given call.  The bill prohibits such long-distance providers (including local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, commercial mobile radio services, interconnected voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP] services, and certain non-interconnected VoIP services) from using an intermediate provider to transmit voice communications and signals unless the intermediate provider is so registered.  The FCC must: (1) ensure the integrity of the transmission of voice communications to all customers in the United States, (2) prevent unjust or unreasonable discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such voice communications, and (3) make a registry of intermediate providers publicly available on the FCC website.  The bill shall not be construed to preempt or expand the authority of a state agency or public utility commission to collect data, or enforce state law and regulations, regarding the completion of intrastate voice communications.  Certain long-distance providers that make initial call path choices are exempt from service quality standards that the FCC is required to establish under this bill if they certify under a safe harbor provision in existing FCC rules that they monitor the performance of, or do not use, intermediate providers.

The bill also extends the statute of limitations for a minor victim of a federal sex offense to file a civil action to 10 years (currently, 3 years) from the date such individual reaches age 18.

DIVISION B--EXTENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018  Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018  (Sec. 2001) This division amends the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to provide continuing FY2018 appropriations to federal agencies through February 8, 2018 (January 19, 2018, under current law).  It ends the government shutdown that began when the existing continuing resolution (CR) expired because none of the 12 FY2018 regular appropriations bills that fund the federal government have been enacted.  This division also adds provisions to the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 that:    permit funds appropriated by the Department of Defense Missile Defeat and Defense Enhancements Appropriations Act, 2018 to be obligated and expended notwithstanding a provision of the National Security Act of 1947 that requires a specific authorization of appropriations for intelligence activities;   provide the Department of Agriculture with funding flexibility to ensure that certain demonstration projects for providing meals to low-income children during the summer will be fully operational by May 2018;   provide the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with funding flexibility to maintain the planned launch capability schedules for the Space Launch System launch vehicle, Exploration Ground Systems, and Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle programs;   provide the Department of Energy with funding flexibility to maintain the June 30, 2017, staffing levels of the Office of Inspector General;   provide the Small Business Administration with funding flexibility to accommodate increased demand for general business loans authorized under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act;  permit the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make certain adjustments to the Section 8 housing choice voucher annual renewal funding allocations and administrative fee eligibility determinations for public housing agencies in an area for which the President declared a disaster in 2017 or 2018 under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; compensate employees furloughed as a result of any lapse in appropriations which began on or about January 20, 2018; and require certain states, federal grantees, and furloughed state employees to be compensated or reimbursed for periods in which there is a lapse in FY2018 appropriations.  (Sec. 2002) This section amends the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 to strike a provision that extended certain authorities provided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) through the duration of the CR. (The FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 was signed into law on January 19, 2018.)  (Sec. 2003) This section specifies that the time covered by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 includes the period that began on or about January 20, 2018, during which there was a lapse in appropriations. DIVISION C--HEALTHY KIDS ACT Helping Ensure Access for Little Ones, Toddlers, and Hopeful Youth by Keeping Insurance Delivery Stable Act or the HEALTHY KIDS Act (Sec. 101) This division extends funding through FY2023 for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund. In addition, the bill reauthorizes through FY2023:  the qualifying-states option (which allows states that provided coverage to now CHIP-eligible children prior to CHIP's enactment to continue to provide such coverage), and  the express-lane eligibility option (which allows states to use eligibility findings from other public benefit programs to determine children's eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP).  Beginning in FY2020, the division allows state child-health plans to adopt more restrictive eligibility standards with respect to children in families whose income exceeds 300% of the poverty line. (Sec. 102) The division extends funding through FY2023 for the Childhood Obesity Demonstration Project and the Pediatric Quality Measures Program. (Sec. 103) The division: (1) extends funding through FY2023 for specified outreach and enrollment grants, and (2) makes eligible for such grants \"parent-mentors\" who are trained to assist families with children who have no health-insurance coverage. Any nominal amount received by an individual for participation as a parent-mentor shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the individual's income-based eligibility for Medicaid. (Sec. 104) Current law provides states with an enhanced Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for child-health assistance through FY2019. The division maintains the enhanced FMAP in FY2020, but halves the percentage-point increase. (Sec. 105) The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services shall make additional funding available to states for specified activities related to mechanized claims systems. DIVISION D--SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN HEALTH-RELATED TAXES  (Sec. 4001) This section amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend for two years (2018 and 2019) the moratorium on the 2.3% excise tax on the sale of medical devices. (Under current law, the moratorium expired at the end of 2017.)  (Sec. 4002) This section amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to delay for two years the implementation of the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage (commonly referred to as the Cadillac tax). Under the bill, the tax will go into effect in 2022 instead of 2020, as required under current law.  (Sec. 4003) This section suspends for 2019 the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share.  DIVISION E--BUDGETARY EFFECTS  (Sec. 5001) This division exempts the budgetary effects of division C and each succeeding division of this bill from Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules and certain budget scorekeeping guidelines.

It directs the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to award competitive grants to health care, law enforcement, or public safety agencies, and nonprofit organizations, to develop or operate locally based proactive programs to prevent wandering and locate missing individuals with dementia or children with developmental disabilities. The BJA must give preference to law enforcement or public safety agencies partnering with nonprofit organizations that use person-centered plans and are directly linked to individuals, and families of individuals, with dementia or developmental disabilities. Additionally, it directs the BJA to award grants to health care, law enforcement, or public safety agencies to develop tracking technology programs to locate missing individuals with dementia or children with developmental disabilities.  The bill subjects grants under the Missing Americans Program to accountability provisions. DOJ's Office of Inspector General must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients. The bill prohibits grants to nonprofit organizations that hold money in an offshore account to avoid tax liability. It also limits the use of grants under this bill for conferences that use more than $20,000 in DOJ funds. DOJ must identify and report on duplicative grant awards. DOJ must also report annually to Congress certain information regarding the Missing Americans Alert Program.  TITLE II--EDUCATION AND OUTREACH (Sec. 201) The bill amends the Missing Children's Assistance Act to specify that, with respect to training and technical assistance provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, cases involving missing and exploited children include cases involving children with developmental disabilities such as autism. TITLE III--PRIVACY PROTECTIONS (Sec. 302) DOJ must establish and certain grant recipients must comply with standards and best practices related to the use of tracking technology to locate missing individuals with dementia or developmental disabilities.
